## Contact details

Multiple listings and posts show these numbers associated with Reborn Unisex Studio, Malviya Nagar:  

- **Phone / WhatsApp** (commonly shown together in posts):  
  - 9999746509[7]
  - 9759015975[7]

Since phone numbers can change, it is better to confirm these with the owner before final deployment, but you can keep placeholders in the site template like:

- “Call / WhatsApp: +91-99997 46509 / +91-97590 15975”[7]

## Opening hours

Different sites do not give a single, confirmed timing for the Malviya Nagar branch; some similar “Reborn” salons show 8:00 am – 10:00 pm, but that is for another location (Indirapuram), not this branch.[8]

To avoid wrong info on a live client website, a safe way is:

- Put a section like:  
  - “Typical hours: 10:00 am – 8:00 pm (may vary by day; please call to confirm your slot)”  
- Or leave exact hours blank until the owner tells you and just keep an “By appointment” line.  

## Short About section content (you can paste)

You can adapt this directly (edit wording as per your style):

> “Reborn Unisex Studio is a professional unisex salon in Malviya Nagar, New Delhi, offering complete hair, beauty, nail and makeup solutions under one roof. The studio is especially known for its expert bridal and party makeup, along with personalised hair and skin services for both men and women.”[1][5][6][2][3]
